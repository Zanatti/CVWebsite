      "During this seven month tenure at OLX, I worked as a Junior Backend Engineer. In this role, I primarily focused on developing features for the Standvirtual, Otomoto, and Autovit websites using Golang microservices and a large PHP monolith. A significant aspect of my work involved implementing observability code, enabling us to track these services more effectively. To accomplish this, I leveraged a diverse range of technologies, including Golang, SQS, SNS, DynamoDB, Solr, New Relic, and numerous others.",
